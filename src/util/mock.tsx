A scientist or an engineer might use it to apply machine learning to their problems. A data analyst might use it to transition to a data scientist position. A student might use it to learn valuable skills. A decision maker might use it to get an intuition about what machine learning is. A manager might use it to interact more effectively with their data scientists. More generally, this book should benefit anyone curious about this fascinating field.",
